    <h3>Our story</h3>

    <p>
      Elevate Initiative (also known as Elevate Through Coffee) was founded by
      Smayah Uwajeneza, a coffee specialist, educator, law school graduate, and
      advocate, whose journey into this work began with her very first trip to
      coffee farm trek when she was just 17 years old while working as a barista
      in Rwanda's first specialty cafe.
